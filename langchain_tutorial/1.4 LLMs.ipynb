       "\"\\n\\n1. Phillips Curve Theory: According to the Phillips Curve, there exists an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. As unemployment decreases, inflation increases and vice versa. This theory suggests that when the economy is at full employment, there is upward pressure on wages and prices, leading to inflation.\\n\\n2. Expectations Theory: This theory states that the relationship between unemployment and inflation depends on people's expectations about future inflation. If people expect inflation to increase, they will demand higher wages, leading to higher inflation. On the other hand, if people expect inflation to decrease, they will be willing to accept lower wages, leading to lower inflation.\\n\\n3. Cost-Push Theory: According to this theory, inflation is caused by a rise in the cost of production, such as an increase in the price of raw materials or labor. This increase in costs leads to higher prices for goods and services, resulting in inflation. Unemployment is seen as a result of high production costs, rather than a cause of inflation.\\n\\n4. Demand-Pull Theory: This theory suggests that inflation is caused by an increase in demand for goods and services, which leads to an increase in prices. As the economy approaches full employment, demand for goods and services increases, leading to higher prices and inflation.\\n\\n5. Natural\""
